== Spring Boot Example with Apache CXF-RS

=== Build

You can build this example using:

    $ mvn package

=== Run

You can run this example using:

    $ mvn spring-boot:run

After the Spring Boot application is started, you can open the following URL in your web browser to access the REST endpoint and retrieve a list of users: http://localhost:8080/services/api/users

You can also access the REST endpoint from the command line:

[source,text]

$ curl http://localhost:8080/services/api/user

The command will produce the following output:

[source,json]
----
[ {
  "id" : 1,
  "name" : "John Coltrane"
}, {
  "id" : 2,
  "name" : "Miles Davis"
}, {
  "id" : 3,

} ]
